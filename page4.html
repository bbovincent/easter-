	<li>Seishiro Nagi (凪なぎ 誠せい士し郎ろう Nagi Seishirō?) was a contender for the Blue Lock Project and the titular protagonist of the spin-off, Blue Lock - Episode Nagi, who played as a rightwing for England's Manshine City in the Neo-Egoist League</li>
	<li>When first arriving at Blue Lock, Nagi was a member of Team V and was the best player in his designated stratum. After the Blue Lock Eleven played against the Japan U-20 team, Nagi was ranked as one of the top players in the project.</li>
	<li> However, after defeating Yoichi Isagi in a one-on-one and scoring a super goal in his match against Bastard München, Nagi had begun to lose his drive to get stronger.</li>
	<li>his downfall sadly ended with him getting locked off at the end of the Neo Egoist League.</li>
